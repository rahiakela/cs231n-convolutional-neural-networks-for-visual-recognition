        "**Motivation**. In this section we will develop expertise with an intuitive understanding of backpropagation, which is a way of computing gradients of expressions through recursive application of chain rule. Understanding of this process and its subtleties is critical for you to understand, and effectively develop, design and debug neural networks.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Motivation**. Recall that the primary reason we are interested in this problem is that in the specific case of neural networks, f will correspond to the loss function $(L)$ and the inputs x will consist of the training data and the neural network weights. For example, the loss could be the SVM loss function and the inputs are both the training data $(x_i,y_i),i=1…N$ and the weights and biases $W,b$. **Note that (as is usually the case in Machine Learning) we think of the training data as given and fixed, and of the weights as variables we have control over. Hence, even though we can easily use backpropagation to compute the gradient on the input examples xi, in practice we usually only compute the gradient for the parameters (e.g. $W,b$) so that we can use it to perform a parameter update**. However, as we will see later in the class the gradient on xi can still be useful sometimes, for example for purposes of visualization and interpreting what the Neural Network might be doing.\n",

Instead, this notation indicates that the operator $\\frac{d}{d {x}}$ is being applied to the function $f$, and returns a different function (the derivative). A nice way to think about the expression above is that when $h$ is very small, then the function is well-approximated by a straight line, and the derivative is its slope. In other words, the derivative on each variable tells you the sensitivity of the whole expression on its value.** For example, if $x=4,y=−3$ then $f(x,y)=−12$ and the derivative on $x \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}=−3$. This tells us that if we were to increase the value of this variable by a tiny amount, the effect on the whole expression would be to decrease it (due to the negative sign), and by three times that amount. This can be seen by rearranging the above equation $( f(x+h)=f(x)+h \\frac{df(x)}{d {x}} )$. Analogously, since $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}=4$, we expect that increasing the value of $y$ by some very small amount h would also increase the output of the function (due to the positive sign), and by $4h$.\n",

That is, if we were to increase it by a tiny amount $h$, the function would keep outputting 4, and therefore the gradient is zero: there is no effect. Of course, if we were to change $y$ by a large amount (e.g. larger than 2), then the value of $f$ would change, but the derivatives tell us nothing about the effect of such large changes on the inputs of a function; They are only informative for tiny, infinitesimally small changes on the inputs, as indicated by the $\\lim_{h \\to 0}$ in its definition."

        "Lets now start to consider more complicated expressions that involve multiple composed functions, such as $f(x,y,z)=(x+y)z$. This expression is still simple enough to differentiate directly, but we’ll take a particular approach to it that will be helpful with understanding the intuition behind backpropagation. In particular, note that this expression can be broken down into two expressions: $q=x+y$ and $f=qz$. Moreover, we know how to compute the derivatives of both expressions separately, as seen in the previous section. $f$ is just multiplication of $q$ and $z$, so $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q}=z,\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}=q$, and $q$ is addition of $x$ and $y$ so $\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x}=1,\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial y}=1$. However, we don’t necessarily care about the gradient on the intermediate value $q$ - the value of $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q}$ is not useful. **Instead, we are ultimately interested in the gradient of f with respect to its inputs $x,y,z$. The chain rule tells us that the correct way to “chain” these gradient expressions together is through multiplication.** For example, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q}\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x}$. In practice this is simply a multiplication of the two numbers that hold the two gradients. Lets see this with an example:"

During the backward pass in which the chain rule is applied recursively backwards through the circuit, the add gate (which is an input to the multiply gate) learns that the gradient for its output was -4. If we anthropomorphize the circuit as wanting to output a higher value (which can help with intuition), then we can think of the circuit as “wanting” the output of the add gate to be lower (due to negative sign), and with a force of 4. To continue the recurrence and to chain the gradient, the add gate takes that gradient and multiplies it to all of the local gradients for its inputs (making the gradient on both $x$ and $y 1 * -4 = -4$). **Notice that this has the desired effect: If $x,y$ were to decrease** (responding to their negative gradient) **then the add gate’s output would decrease, which in turn makes the multiply gate’s output increase.**\n",

As shown in the code above, in practice it is always helpful to break down the forward pass into stages that are easily backpropped through. For example here we created an intermediate variable $dot$ which holds the output of the dot product between $w$ and $x$.

For example, the three most commonly used gates in neural networks (add,mul,max), all have very simple interpretations in terms of how they act during backpropagation. Consider this example circuit:\n",

        "\n",
        "The add gate always takes the gradient on its output and distributes it equally to all of its inputs, regardless of what their values were during the forward pass. This follows from the fact that the local gradient for the add operation is simply +1.0, so the gradients on all inputs will exactly equal the gradients on the output because it will be multiplied by x1.0 (and remain unchanged). In the example circuit above, note that the + gate routed the gradient of 2.00 to both of its inputs, equally and unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "The max gate routes the gradient. Unlike the add gate which distributed the gradient unchanged to all its inputs, the max gate distributes the gradient (unchanged) to exactly one of its inputs (the input that had the highest value during the forward pass). This is because the local gradient for a max gate is 1.0 for the highest value, and 0.0 for all other values. In the example circuit above, the max operation routed the gradient of 2.00 to the $z$ variable, which had a higher value than $w$, and the gradient on $w$ remains zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "The multiply gate is a little less easy to interpret. Its local gradients are the input values (except switched), and this is multiplied by the gradient on its output during the chain rule. In the example above, the gradient on $x$ is -8.00, which is $-4.00 x 2.00$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unintuitive effects and their consequences. Notice that if one of the inputs to the multiply gate is very small and the other is very big, then the multiply gate will do something slightly unintuitive: it will assign a relatively huge gradient to the small input and a tiny gradient to the large input. Note that in linear classifiers where the weights are dot producted $w^Tx_i$ (multiplied) with the inputs, this implies that the scale of the data has an effect on the magnitude of the gradient for the weights. For example, if you multiplied all input data examples $x_i$ by 1000 during preprocessing, then the gradient on the weights will be 1000 times larger, and you’d have to lower the learning rate by that factor to compensate. This is why preprocessing matters a lot, sometimes in subtle ways! And having intuitive understanding for how the gradients flow can help you debug some of these cases.\n",

        "Tip: use dimension analysis! Note that you do not need to remember the expressions for $dW$ and $dX$ because they are easy to re-derive based on dimensions. For instance, we know that the gradient on the weights $dW$ must be of the same size as $W$ after it is computed, and that it must depend on matrix multiplication of $X$ and dD (as is the case when both $X,W$ are single numbers and not matrices). There is always exactly one way of achieving this so that the dimensions work out. For example, $X$ is of size $[10 x 3]$ and $dD$ of size $[5 x 3]$, so if we want $dW$ and $W$ has shape $[5 x 10]$, then the only way of achieving this is with $dD.dot(X.T)$, as shown above.\n",

Our recommendation is to explicitly write out a minimal vectorized example, derive the gradient on paper and then generalize the pattern to its efficient, vectorized form.\n",

        "* We discussed the importance of staged computation for practical implementations of backpropagation. You always want to break up your function into modules for which you can easily derive local gradients, and then chain them with chain rule. Crucially, you almost never want to write out these expressions on paper and differentiate them symbolically in full, because you never need an explicit mathematical equation for the gradient of the input variables. Hence, decompose your expressions into stages such that you can differentiate every stage independently (the stages will be matrix vector multiplies, or max operations, or sum operations, etc.) and then backprop through the variables one step at a time.\n",
